We're facing existential threats like climate change, authoritarianism, devious technology, and war. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut if these sci-fi stories are prescient, it means we don't figure it out; instead, the world turns into a dystopian shitscape – and after that do we figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGE|arc2\r\n\r\n\r\nCritics have <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/why-optimistic-science-fiction-is-dead-1511567018\">pointed out</a> that our sci-fi has become pessimistic. Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/omnisscreenfligh00pear/page/250/mode/2up\">argued</a> that this pessimism is necessary for a good story: “Futuristic science fiction tends to be pessimistic. If you imagine a future that’s wonderful, you don’t have a story.” Or perhaps we, as a culture, have become pessimistic; after all, news stories constantly remind us that authoritarianism is on the rise and that earth is inevitably going to warm so much that it'll kill millions of people.
