But as we walk out of the theater, we're thrust back into reality – a world where we're still facing existential threats like climate change, authoritarianism, devious technology, and war. And if these sci-fi stories are prescient, it means that we will soon experience those existential threats; the world will soon turn into a dystopian hellscape; and only after that do we figure it out.\r

\r
In other words, the worst is still ahead of us.\r

News stories constantly remind us that we’re headed for trouble. Children are being murdered, authoritarianism is on the rise, and Earth is inevitably going to warm so much that it'll kill millions of people. Given this, how could we possibly imagine a less bleak future?\r
